The table features req/resp is a list of OFPTableFeaturesStats objects.
Each OFPTableFeaturesStats object has the following simple properties:config,length,max_entries,metadata_match,metadata_write,name,table_id.
It also has the complex member properties which is a heterogeneous list containing at most one each of 16 different objects.
These 16 objects are uniquely identified by a type ID (0..15), but are represented by a smaller number of object classes:
 * OFPTableFeaturePropInstructions (type 0,1)
   member 'instruction_ids'  contains [OFPInstructionId]
 * OFPTableFeaturePropNextTables (type 2,3)
   member 'table_ids' contains integers
 * OFPTableFeaturePropActions (type 4-7)
   member action_ids contains [OFPActionId]
 * OFPTableFeaturePropOxm (type 8,10,12,13,14,15)
   member oxm_ids contains [OFPOxmId]
